 ASS1	ASS5  ASS4  ASS3  ASS2
 
 2. List the directory contents size wise sorted.(man ls)ASS1.txt 
 samarth@W2-87083:dir -s

5. Create a file, write your surname and name in it and
save.

samarth@W2-87083:cat>> Sam.txt

i. now open the same file and add your address in it and
save.
samarth@W2-87083:echo address:HOUSE NO-339,VITTHAL NAGAR, BARSHI.
ADDRESS:HOUSE NO-339,VITTHAL NAGAR, BARSHI.


7. Create directory structure : Give following commands ,
-> mkdir one
-> cd one
-> touch 1.txt 11.txt 111.txt
-> mkdir two
-> cd two
-> touch 2.txt 22.txt 222.txt
-> mkdir three
-> cd three
-> touch 3.txt 33.txt 333.txt
-> mkdir four
-> cd four
-> touch 4.txt 44.txt 444.txt
-> mkdir five
-> cd five
-> touch 5.txt 55.txt 555.txt
-> cd ~

samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment$ mkdir one
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment$ cd one
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one$  touch 1.txt 11.txt 111.txt
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one$  mkdir two
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one$  cd two
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two$ touch 2.txt 22.txt 222.txt 
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two$ mkdir three
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two$ cd three
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three$  touch 3.txt 33.txt 333.txt
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three$  mkdir four 
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three$ cd four
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three/four$ touch .txt 44.txt 444.txt
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three/four$ mkdir five
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three/four$ cd five
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three/four/five$  touch 5.txt 55.txt 555.txt 
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one/two/three/four/five$ cd ~


8. Considering above directory structure , Do following
operations :
i. list the directory contents of directory named
"five" from current directory (i.e. home directory).

samarth@W2-87083:Home/Assignment/one/two/three/four/five  >> ASS1.txt
555.txt  55.txt  5.txt

ii. write your name in a file named "44.txt" of
directory "four" from current directory.
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork$ cat > 444.txt
NAME: SAMARTH ZADBUKE

iii. remove the file named "555.txt" from directory
"five" from current directory.
samarth@W2-87083: rm Assignment/one/two/three/four/five/555.txt


iv. change directory to five
one/two/three/four/five/ )

samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork$ cd Assignment/one/two/three/four/five

samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork$ echo "COURSE:DMC" > Assignment/one/two/three/3.txt
COURSE:DMC

vi. list the contents of directory "two" from current
directory (i.e. five).
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork$ ls Assignment/one/two

vii. remove file named "222.txt" which belongs to
directory "two" from current directory (i.e. five)
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork$ rm Assignment/one/two/222.txt

viii. now change the directory to "one"
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork$ cd Assignment/one

ix. remove all files only from directory named "five"
from current directory (i.e. one)
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one$ rm Assignment/one/two/three/four/five/*

x. remove directory named "five" from current directory
(i.e. one)
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one$ rmdir two/three/four/five

xi. remove whole directory named "four" from current
directory (i.e. one)
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment/one$ rm -r two/three/four


xii. change to your home directory.
samarth@W2-87083:~/classwork/Assignment$ cd ~
